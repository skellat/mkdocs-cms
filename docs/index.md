### About Us

Erie Looking Productions is based in Ashtabula, Ohio.  We are a boutique multi-platform media arts shop available for contract work and consultation.  We provide unique solutions for you from work in [LaTeX2e](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to audio production to video editing and more. Examples of audio works we have created can be found online at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22Erie%20Looking%20Productions%22&and[]=mediatype%3A%22audio%22).

Stephen Michael Kellat does **not** presently have an operational personal blog as of October 9, 2021.  There are no restoration plans for that at this time.  Limited microblogging is available from him [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/writer_smk).  

Literary works by Stephen [are currently available for purchase via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Michael-Kellat/e/B085MR8Y8J).  Works are available in a variety of formats.  

### Serving You In The COVID-19 Crisis

We continue to monitor and react to the [COVID-19 crisis](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19).  The long-running crisis has shaped how we operate.  After nearly two years we've come to a view that the pre-coronavirus world isn't coming back.  We're looking at how we can move forward boldly into a new future.
