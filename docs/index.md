### About Us

Erie Looking Productions is based in Ashtabula, Ohio.  We are a boutique multi-platform media arts shop available for contract work and consultation.  We work in [LaTeX2e](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), audiovisual editing, creative consulting, and more to provide unique solutions. Examples of audio works we have created can be found online at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22Erie%20Looking%20Productions%22&and[]=mediatype%3A%22audio%22).

Various literary works by our proprietor, Stephen Michael Kellat, [are currently available for purchase via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Michael-Kellat/e/B085MR8Y8J).  Works are available in a variety of formats.  They were typeset by us.  

### Serving You In The COVID-19 Crisis

We continue to monitor and react to the [COVID-19 crisis](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19).  The long-running crisis shaped how we operate.  After nearly two years we've come to a view that the pre-coronavirus world isn't coming back *completely* any time soon, if at all.  We're looking at how we can move forward boldly into a new future.
