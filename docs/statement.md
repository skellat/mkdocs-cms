## The Situation

We continue to monitor the [invasion of Ukraine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).  We also follow the [Shields Up campaign](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  To that end we *may* engage from time to time in limited mirroring actions keeping as close as possible to [Archive Team practices](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/) to ensure access to online resources in the event of collateral damage from [cyberwarfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare) impacting assets in the United States of America.  It is our understanding that actions in the cyberwarfare realm do not stay well confined to one geographic area.  Although online information can be very fragile in an unstable world, we do not expect a so-called ["Digital Dark Age"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_dark_age).  We do expect things to be unnecessarily messy.
