## Preparatory Actions

We continue to monitor the [Ukraine crisis](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Russo-Ukrainian_crisis) that appears ready to go kinetic at any time.  To that end we may engage in limited mirroring actions to ensure action to online resources in the event of anti-satellite warfare and cyberwarfare breaking out.  It is our understanding that actions in those kinetic domains do not stay well confined to one geographic area.  Although online information can be very fragile in an unstable world, we do not expect a so-called ["Digital Dark Age"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_dark_age).  We do expect things to be unnecessarily messy.

## Planned Actions

Reviewing technical materials on [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP) and its spiritual successor [NNCP](http://www.nncpgo.org/) are likely in order.  Going back to [the ancient ways](http://www.bbscorner.com/telnetbbs/telnetoverview.htm) may definitely be considered.  Besides, the [dog-related network](http://www.bbscorner.com/bbsnetworks/fidonet.htm) has lasted quite a while as an alternative modality.
