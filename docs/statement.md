## The Situation

We continue to monitor the [invasion of Ukraine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).  We also follow the [Shields Up campaign](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  We are becoming greatly concerned over [Trumpism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism) and the dark paths that it is leading our nation towards.  All in all this affects our operational posture and shifts us to a stance of viewing greater location flexibility as a desired outcome now.

## Planned Actions

In no particular order:

* Work on forking the [newspaper package](https://ctan.org/pkg/newspaper) on CTAN to create a framework for [samizdat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat) publications such as currently seen from the [*Zvezda* newspaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20220521012308/https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-press-freedom-day-samizdat-perm-zvezda/31832108.html)
