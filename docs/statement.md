## Actions

We continue to monitor the [invasion of Ukraine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).  We also follow the [Shields Up campaign](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  To that end we *may* engage from time to time in limited mirroring actions keeping as close as possible to [Archive Team practices](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/) to ensure access to online resources in the event of collateral damage from [cyberwarfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare) impacting assets in the United States of America.  It is our understanding that actions in the cyberwarfare realm do not stay well confined to one geographic area.  Although online information can be very fragile in an unstable world, we do not expect a so-called ["Digital Dark Age"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_dark_age).  We do expect things to be unnecessarily messy.  

## Planned Actions

In no particular order:

* Reviewing technical materials on [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP) and its spiritual successor [NNCP](http://www.nncpgo.org/)
* Reviewing [operational methods behind the ancient way of the "BBS"](http://www.bbscorner.com/telnetbbs/telnetoverview.htm) 
* Review the status of [dog-related network](http://www.bbscorner.com/bbsnetworks/fidonet.htm) 
* Adjust our radio-based equipment for better reception of Over The Air data streams such as [NAVTEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAVTEX) and [WEFAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofax#Weatherfax)
* Review various ways of impromptu knowledge recording such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitizdat), [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat), and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribs_(recordings))
