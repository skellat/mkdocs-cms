## Preparatory Actions

We continue to monitor the [Ukraine crisis](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Russo-Ukrainian_crisis).  That unfortunate situation appears ready to go kinetic at any time.  To that end we *may* engage in limited mirroring actions keeping as close as possible to [Archive Team practices](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/) to ensure access to online resources in the event of [anti-satellite warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon) and [cyberwarfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare) breaking out.  It is our understanding that actions in those kinetic domains do not stay well confined to one geographic area.  Although online information can be very fragile in an unstable world, we do not expect a so-called ["Digital Dark Age"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_dark_age).  We do expect things to be unnecessarily messy.

## Planned Actions

Reviewing technical materials on [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP) and its spiritual successor [NNCP](http://www.nncpgo.org/) are likely in order.  Going back to [the ancient ways](http://www.bbscorner.com/telnetbbs/telnetoverview.htm) may definitely be considered.  Besides, the [dog-related network](http://www.bbscorner.com/bbsnetworks/fidonet.htm) has lasted quite a while as an alternative modality.
