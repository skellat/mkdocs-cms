### Filmed Services

We previously recorded condensed worship services for a variety of video platforms on short turnaround in April 2020.  

We resumed posting filmed church services in November 2020.  Those works are presently [posted to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOXfWtVAbaXrRrBsx5baFjg) while we continue to investigate establishing our own hosting infrastructure.  

The filming of services is currently held in abeyance.  That was announced in a [video posted to the YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/_7biCeGEuoM).  Due to a mix of events beyond our control it appears video production operations relative to filmed worship services may not resume for some time.  Nothing in human life is truly static.

### Other Actions

Typesetting of worship materials using [LaTeX2e](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is one of our specialties that we have had to leverage repeatedly.  Utilizing thorough knowledge of radio frequency tech we even got a church parking lot [rigged legally for FM sound temporarily](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microbroadcasting&oldid=1005457777) for drive-in services in May 2020.  These solutions and more have been part of our work during this continuing crisis.  

In a time of many questions we can offer solutions to at least some of your problems.  We may not be a traditional partner that you would consider but in these times of change are problem-solvers worth considering.  Contact us for a consultation.
