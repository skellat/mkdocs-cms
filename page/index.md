## Your Boutique Multi-Platform Media Arts Shop

Erie Looking Productions is based in Ashtabula, Ohio.  We are a boutique multi-platform media arts shop available for contract work and consultations.  We work in audiovisual editing, creative assistance, [LaTeX2e](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), and more to provide unique solutions. Examples of audio works we have created can be found online at the Internet Archive.  We are generally looking to expand our offerings over time.

### To Reach Us

For more information, please contact us [via Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/y_Uhscjs0De-nEmLgVtbpjSO6uI60sns7LHTpJkrUvAdnEzDVuRGIqdVd1nLMBpI).  We are presently *not* hosting our own e-mail due to rather adverse factors in the realm of e-mail service hosting including costs.  This will change in the future as we evaluate shifting to an appropriate solution such as ones provided by NextCloud and Microsoft Teams.

### Regular Commercial Services Offered

During the seemingly permanent polycrisis we must be creative in meeting service requests.  Please contact us to discuss service availability for your project.  An illustrative list of possible services would generally include matters in the realms of audiovisual work, print production, and aid to religious groups.
