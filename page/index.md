## Ashtabula's Boutique Multi-Platform Media Arts Shop

Erie Looking Productions is based in Ashtabula, Ohio.  We are a boutique multi-platform media arts shop available for contract work and consultations.  We work in audiovisual editing, creative assistance, [LaTeX](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), and more to provide unique solutions. Examples of audio works we have created can be found online at the Internet Archive.  We generally seek to expand our offerings over time.

### To Reach Us

For more information, please contact us [via Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/y_Uhscjs0De-nEmLgVtbpjSO6uI60sns7LHTpJkrUvAdnEzDVuRGIqdVd1nLMBpI).  We are presently *not* hosting our own e-mail due to rather adverse factors in the realm of e-mail service hosting including costs.  This will change in the future as we evaluate shifting to an appropriate solution such as ones provided by NextCloud and Microsoft Teams.

### Regular Commercial Services Offered

Many functions are presently being held in abeyance due to the present government of our country.  While you can contact us to discuss projects, please be advised that we are in a difficult position relative to starting new work.  Of course, isn't everyone in this economy?

### Our Works-In-Progress & Planned Efforts

* Reinforcing our operational infrastructure 
* Creation of a streaming video bulletin board using appropriate technologies
* Continuing participation in the work of the [Ashtabula County Broadband Task Force ](https://www.ashtabulacounty.us/767/Broadband-Taskforce)
