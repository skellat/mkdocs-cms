# The Erie Looking Productions Website

This is **the** website for Erie Looking Productions via Netlify.  This continues to not be the *sole* website for Erie Looking Productions, though.  Materials can still be found at [ELP Television](https://coyote.works).  This is also *not* Stephen's blog which is found at <https://kellat.me>.  We are launching a podcast called 69 Admins at <https://69admins.com>.

Updates continue as the world around us continues to be far stranger than expected.  Eventually this may migrate off [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to another solution.

This site can be found at <https://erielookingproductions.info>.  Presently it is hosted on hardware under immediate physical control.
