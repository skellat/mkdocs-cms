# The Erie Looking Productions Website

This is **the** website for Erie Looking Productions.  This continues to not be the *sole* website for Erie Looking Productions, though.  Materials can still be found at [ELP Television](https://coyote.works).  This is also *not* Stephen's blog which is found at <https://kellat.me>.  We launched a podcast called 69 Admins at <https://69admins.com> many episodes ago though that podcast went dark with the rise of the Trump regime.

Updates continue as the world around us continues to be far stranger than expected.  Eventually this may migrate off [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to another solution.

This site can be found at <https://erielookingproductions.info>.  Hosting is being handled via GitHub Pages like many of its sister sites.  Alternative solutions need to be sought.
